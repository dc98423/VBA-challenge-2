I HATE VBA

I was not able to complete this assignment in its entirety after working all weekend on it.

The code works but is not accurate on the 2016 sheet.  I could not figure out how to make the determination of
first and last cells float depending on how many ticker values there were; so I had to use a set # which is obviously
not the correct way to do this.

I also could not figure out how to import the appropriate ticker names to the side chart with the corresponding
values "Greatest % increase" etc.. so they were left blank.

One thing that seemed weird to me is when I ran my code, initially the "<percent change>" column did not populate.

Then I ran it again and everything popped up.

I included two screen shots of this so you could see.  One before and one after.
